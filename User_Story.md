## Those “Seaking Help”

- **Help Request Submission:**  
  As a person affected by a wildfire, I want to submit a request for help outside of the common categories. I also want to know when my request has been acknowledged quickly.

- **Shelter Updates:**  
  As a person affected by a wildfire, I want real-time updates on shelters, including the distance from my location and how many people they can shelter.

- **Incident Reporting:**  
  As a person affected by a wildfire, I want to be able to report fires, blocked roads, and detours in my area.

- **Information Clarity:**  
  As a person affected by a wildfire, I fear this app would cause panic if it is flooded with information and false reports. I want to be able to access the information I need without clutter, further complicating and causing panic in an already stressful time.

- **Offline Navigation:**  
  As a person affected by a wildfire, I would like offline map data of my area so I can at least navigate local streets or avoid busy highways with no or limited connection to networks.

- **General Resources:**  
  As a person affected by a wildfire, I want to know more general resources and helplines beyond just local help.

- **Factual Updates:**  
  As a person affected by a wildfire, I want real-time factual updates from fire stations about whether the fire is contained, spreading, and a general idea of what is being done.

## Volunteers Seeking to Help

- **Real-Time Alerts:**  
  As a volunteer, I want to receive real-time alerts when there’s a wildfire within a 50-mile radius, so I can offer my help but also keep myself safe and out of the way for firefighters.

- **Skill and Status Display:**  
  As a volunteer, I want to be able to display my skills and assets and other ways I can help. I want to track my contributions in the app along with setting my status to “Currently Working”, “Available/On Call”, and “Not Available.”

- **Guidance for Action:**  
  As a volunteer, I want to immediately know where to go to get started on helping and what to bring (food, shelters, medical supplies, just a helping hand).

## Donors

- **Donation Location:**  
  As a donor, I want to quickly find where I can donate and deliver supplies, and understand what type of place it’s going to (Shelter, Food Pantry, Fire Station).

- **Donation Verification:**  
  As a distant monetary donor, I want to be able to verify my donation is in the right hands and know what my donation is being used for.

- **Donation Updates:**  
  As a monetary donor, I want to receive updates on my donations and how they impacted those affected. The sooner I know about how I helped, the more likely I am to donate again.

- **Community Initiatives:**  
  As a community member, I want to be able to start a call-to-action and initiate fundraising campaigns with communities.

## Firefighters

- **Volunteer Coordination:**  
  As a firefighter, I want to be able to direct volunteer dispatches so they can meet somewhere safe and help in meaningful ways without getting in the way, causing panic, or running around in a disorganized fashion.

- **Exclusive Features:**  
  As a firefighter, I want firefighter-specific features that aren’t accessible to the public so the app is mutually beneficial without causing confusion.

- **Administrative Communication:**  
  As a fire station administrator, I want to be able to send messages out to app users to inform and update those affected and volunteers.
